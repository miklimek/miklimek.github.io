## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I've no clue what to write here, but so as to meet the minimal requirements I need to write _something_, so I'll just write about how I don't konw what to write.

### Classic
```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```
### Conclusions
Hopefully this is enough to satisfy you. Feel free to bask in the emptiness of this page however long you wish for and have a nice day.
